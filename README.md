## Project Overview
In the current landscape with immense growth potential for Electric Vehicles (EVs), there is a growing need for more information regarding the benefits and challenges they bring. As a response, our team has developed the ElectroForesight Dashboard. Our objective is to illustrate a range of external factors influencing the future quantity of EVs.

We have employed data modeling to predict the impact of GDP growth on the increase in electric car sales. Furthermore, we have explored how the rising number of electric vehicles might affect the power grid's load. Employing two models based on AEMO's data, we've identified that 10 am and 7 pm are peak electricity usage hours due to behavioral patterns. We have devised separate models for Day and Night scenarios to depict the projected impact of growing EV electricity demand on the grid's power consumption. Based on our assumptions, assuming EV charging habits remain consistent with the current nighttime charging behavior in the models, the demand could surpass the current grid capability earlier than during daytime charging.

Additionally, we have pondered the relationship between EV development and energy storage, yielding valuable insights into sustainable energy supply considerations.

### Forecast Generation with Python
You can use the Forecast Generator tool by running it in Python. Make sure to adjust the date ranges for the periods you want to forecast and change the file name to the CSV file you wish to read. Also, ensure that you modify the export file name to prevent overriding existing files.

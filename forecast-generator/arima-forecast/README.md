# ARIMA Model Practice

This project is an adaptation of the tutorial available at [machinelearningmastery.com](https://machinelearningmastery.com/arima-for-time-series-forecasting-with-python/), with modifications to run on a different dataset for the purpose of forecasting in a hackathon scenario in the year 2023.

## Introduction

The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model is a widely used approach for time series forecasting. It combines autoregression, differencing, and moving average components to capture patterns and trends in time series data. In this project, we've adapted the tutorial's ARIMA model to forecast a different dataset, focusing on predicting sales for a specific domain, specifically for a hackathon event taking place in 2023.

## Dataset

The original tutorial utilized a dataset related to electric vehicle (EV) sales, which was replaced with our own dataset for the hackathon. This dataset is relevant to the hackathon's theme and contains historical data related to the domain of interest. We're aiming to use the ARIMA model to predict sales for the year 2023 in order to assist with event planning and resource allocation.

## Adaptation and Modifications

The tutorial's code has been adapted to accommodate the new dataset, including adjusting data loading, date formatting, and forecasting. Additionally, we've customized the parameters of the ARIMA model, such as adjusting the order of autoregressive (p) and moving average (q) components, to best fit the characteristics of the new dataset and to improve the accuracy of our forecasts.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in your terminal.
3. Ensure you have the appropriate dataset (CSV file) for the domain you want to forecast. Replace the existing dataset file with yours.
4. Adjust the dataset loading and preprocessing code in `arima_forecast.py` to match your dataset's structure.
5. Run the adapted ARIMA model using the modified code provided in `arima_forecast.py`. This will generate forecasts for the specified period (e.g., 2023-2050).
6. Integrate the generated forecast into your project. You can create a component that fetches the forecast data using API communication tools and displays it in your React application.

## Conclusion

By adapting the ARIMA model to a new dataset and domain, we've created a forecasting tool that's tailored to the needs of a hackathon event in 2023. This demonstrates the versatility and practicality of time series forecasting techniques in various real-world scenarios. You can further enhance the accuracy and reliability of your forecasts by experimenting with different model parameters, incorporating additional features, and continuously refining your approach based on real-time data.

Feel free to experiment, customize, and expand upon this project to suit your specific hackathon or forecasting needs. Good luck with your hackathon event in 2023!
